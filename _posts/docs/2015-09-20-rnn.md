## Overall Framework
<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/image/rnn1.png" style="width: 450px"/>
<p><strong> Figure.1 - Overall Framework for RNN Language Model</strong></p>

The recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) implemented in SINGA is illustrated in Figure 1.

Given a sequence of input words, this model predicts the next word. The training objective is to maximize the probability that the next word is correctly predicted. The performance metric - perplexity per word is employed in this language model. It should be noted that minimizing the perplexity value is equivalent to maximizing the probability of correct prediction. Please refer to [this page][1] to find more about perplexity.

In this RNNLM, 7 layers are implemented specific for this application, including 1 data layer which fetches data records from the data shard below, 2 parser layers which parse the input records, 3 neuron layers which process the input records and 1 loss layer which computes the performance metrics ([more details for layers]({{ BASE_PATH }}/docs/layer)). First, we describe the data shard and how to create it for this application. Then, we discuss the configuration and functionality of layers. Finally, we introduce how to configure a job and then run the training for your own model.



## Data Shard

Example files for RNNLM can be found in `SINGA_ROOT/examples/rnnlm`, which we assume to be WORKSPACE.

(c) Download raw data

This example downloads rnnlm-0.4b from [www.rnnlm.org][2] by a command

    $ make download

The raw data is stored as `rnnlm-0.4b/train` and `rnnlm-0.4b/test`.

(b) Define your own record. Please refer to [Data Preparation]({{ BASE_PATH }}/docs/data) for details.

Records for RNNLM example are defined in `user.proto` as an extension.

    package singa;

    import "common.proto";  // Record message for SINGA is defined
    import "job.proto";     // Layer message for SINGA is defined

    extend Record {
        optional WordClassRecord wordclass = 101;
        optional SingleWordRecord singleword = 102;
    }

    message WordClassRecord {
        optional int32 class_index = 1; // the index of this class
        optional int32 start = 2;       // the index of the start word in this class;
        optional int32 end = 3;         // the index of the end word in this class
    }

    message SingleWordRecord {
        optional string word = 1;
        optional int32 word_index = 2;  // the index of this word in the vocabulary
        optional int32 class_index = 3; // the index of the class corresponding to this word
    }

(c) Create data shard for training and testing

Data shards (e.g., "shard.dat") will be created in folders `rnnlm_class_shard`, `rnnlm_vocab_shard, `rnnlm_word_shard_train` and `rnnlm_word_shard_test` by a command

    $ make create


## Layers' Configuration and Functionality

Similar to records, layers are also defined in `user.proto` as an extension.

A new configuration field is added for layers with special configuration requirements. In this language model, we have 5 layers with special requirements as follows.

    package singa;
    import "common.proto";  // Record message for SINGA is defined
    import "job.proto";     // Layer message for SINGA is defined

    extend LayerProto {
        optional RnnlmComputationProto rnnlmcomputation_conf = 201;
        optional RnnlmSigmoidProto rnnlmsigmoid_conf = 202;
        optional RnnlmInnerproductProto rnnlminnerproduct_conf = 203;
        optional RnnlmWordinputProto rnnlmwordinput_conf = 204;
        optional RnnlmDataProto rnnlmdata_conf = 207;
    }

The detailed configuration and functionality information of the layers are discussed below.

### RnnlmDataLayer

#### Configuration

In order to improve the computation speed of word prediction, all words in the vocabulary are divided into classes. During the prediction process, firstly the class of the next word is predicted. Then, the next word is predicted within the predicted class.

RnnlmDataLayer is in charge of reading the information from both class shard and word shard. Three parameters for this layer are defined as below, and the parameter values are set in `job.conf`.

    message RnnlmDataProto {
        required string class_path = 1;  // path to the class data file/folder, absolute or relative to the workspace
        required string word_path = 2;   // path to the word data file/folder, absolute or relative to the workspace
        required int32 window_size = 3;  // window size.
    }

#### Functionality

In setup phase, this layer first constructs the mapping information between classes and words by reading information from ClassShard. For the consistency of operations at each training iteration, it maintains a record vector (length of window_size + 1). It reads the 1st record from the WordShard and puts it in the last position of record vector.

    void RnnlmDataLayer::Setup() {
    	  Assign values to classinfo_;	// Store mapping information between classes and words
        Resize length of records_ as window_size + 1
        Read the 1st word record to the last position
    }

After setting up this layer, the forward computation phase begins.

    void RnnlmDataLayer::ComputeFeature() {
        records_[0] = records_[windowsize_];	// Copy the last record to the 1st position in the record vector
        Assign values to records_;	//Read window_size new word records from WordShard
    }


### RnnlmWordParserLayer

#### Configuration

This layer is in charge of reading word records from RnnlmDataLayer and then passes the records to the neuron layers above. We will configure the "name", "type" and "srclayers" for this parser layer. More details of this layer's configuration can be seen in `job.conf`.

#### Functionality

In setup phase, this layer obtains the window size and vocabulary size from its source layer (i.e., RnnlmDataLayer) and then reshapes the data in this layer specific to its functionality.

    void RnnlmWordparserLayer::Setup() {
        Obtain window size from src layer;
        Obtain vocabulary size from src layer;
        Reshape data_ as {window_size};
    }

After being set up, this parser layer fetches the "window_size" number of word records from RnnlmDataLayer and stores them as data. The details can be seen below.

    void RnnlmWordparserLayer::ParseRecords() {
        for(int i = 0; i < records.size() - 1; i++) {	//The first window_size records
            Copy the word index of records[i] to data_[i];
        }
    }

### RnnlmClassParserLayer

#### Configuration

This layer fetches the class information (the mapping information between classes and words) from RnnlmDataLayer and maintains this information as data in this layer.

#### Functionality

In setup phase, this layer obtains the window size, vocabulary size and class size from its source layer (i.e., RnnlmDataLayer) and then reshapes the data in this layer according to the needs.

    void RnnlmClassparserLayer::Setup() {
        Obtain window size from src layer;
        Obtain vocaubulary size from src layer;
        Obtain class size from src layer;
        Reshape data_ as {windowsize_, 4};
    }

Next, this layer parses the last "window_size" number of word records from RnnlmDataLayer and stores them as data. Then, it retrieves the corresponding class for each input word. It stores the starting word index of this class, ending word index of this class, word index and class index respectively.

    void RnnlmClassparserLayer::ParseRecords() {
        for(int i = 1; i < records.size(); i++) {
            Copy starting word index in this class to data[i]'s 1st position;
            Copy ending word index in this class to data[i]'s 2nd position;
            Copy index of input word to data[i]'s 3rd position;
            Copy class index of input word to data[i]'s 4th position;
        }
    }


### RnnlmWordInputLayer

Using the input word records, this layer obtains corresponding word vectors as its data. Then, it passes the data to RnnlmInnerProductLayer above for further processing.

#### Configuration

In this layer, the length of each word vector needs to be configured. Besides, whether to use bias term during the training process should also be configured.

    message RnnlmWordinputProto {
        required int32 word_length = 1;  // vector length for each input word
        optional bool bias_term = 30 [default = true];  // use bias vector or not
    }

#### Functionality

In setup phase, this layer first reshapes its members such as "data", "grad", and "weight" matrix. Then, it obtains the vocabulary size from its source layer (i.e., RnnlmWordParserLayer).

In the forward phase, using the "window_size" number of input word indices, the "window_size" number of word vectors are selected from this layer's weight matrix, each word index corresponding to one row.

    void RnnlmWordinputLayer::ComputeFeature() {
        for(int t = 0; t < windowsize_; t++){
            data[t] = weight[src[t]];
        }
    }

In the backward phase, after computing this layer's gradient in its destination layer (i.e., RnnlmInnerProductLayer), here the gradient of the weight matrix in this layer is copied (by row corresponding to word indices) from this layer's gradient.

    void RnnlmWordinputLayer::ComputeGradient() {
        for(int t = 0; t < windowsize_; t++){
            gweight[src[t]] = grad[t];
        }
    }


### RnnlmInnerProductLayer

This is a neuron layer which receives the data from RnnlmWordInputLayer and sends the computation results to RnnlmSigmoidLayer.

#### Configuration
In this layer, the number of neurons needs to be specified. Besides, whether to use a bias term should also be configured.

    message RnnlmInnerproductProto {
        required int32 num_output = 1;	//Number of outputs for the layer
        optional bool bias_term = 30 [default = true];	//Use bias vector or not
    }

#### Functionality

In the forward phase, this layer is in charge of executing the dot multiplication between its weight matrix and the data in its source layer (i.e., RnnlmWordInputLayer).

    void RnnlmInnerproductLayer::ComputeFeature() {
        data = dot(src, weight);	//Dot multiplication operation
    }

In the backward phase, this layer needs to first compute the gradient of its source layer (i.e., RnnlmWordInputLayer). Then, it needs to compute the gradient of its weight matrix by aggregating computation results for each timestamp. The details can be seen as follows.

    void RnnlmInnerproductLayer::ComputeGradient() {
        for (int t = 0; t < windowsize_; t++) {
            Add the dot product of src[t] and grad[t] to gweight;
        }
        Copy the dot product of grad and weight to gsrc;
    }

### RnnlmSigmoidLayer

This is a neuron layer for computation. During the computation in this layer, each component of the member data specific to one timestamp uses its previous timestamp's data component as part of the input. This is how the time-order information is utilized in this language model application.

Besides, if you want to implement a recurrent neural network following our design, this layer is of vital importance for you to refer to. Also, you can always think of other design methods to make use of information from past timestamps.

#### Configuration

In this layer, whether to use a bias term needs to be specified.

    message RnnlmSigmoidProto {
        optional bool bias_term = 1 [default = true];  // use bias vector or not
    }

#### Functionality

In the forward phase, this layer first receives data from its source layer (i.e., RnnlmInnerProductLayer) which is used as one part input for computation. Then, for each timestampe this layer executes a dot multiplication between its previous timestamp information and its own weight matrix. The results are the other part for computation. This layer sums these two parts together and executes an activation operation. The detailed descriptions for this process are illustrated as follows.

    void RnnlmSigmoidLayer::ComputeFeature() {
        for(int t = 0; t < window_size; t++){
            if(t == 0) Copy the sigmoid results of src[t] to data[t];
            else Compute the dot product of data[t - 1] and weight, and add sigmoid results of src[t] to be data[t];
       }
    }

In the backward phase, this RnnlmSigmoidLayer first updates this layer's member grad utilizing the information from current timestamp's next timestamp. Then respectively, this layer computes the gradient for its weight matrix and its source layer RnnlmInnerProductLayer by iterating different timestamps. The process can be seen below.

    void RnnlmSigmoidLayer::ComputeGradient() {
        Update grad[t];	// Update the gradient for the current layer, add a new term from next timestamp
        for (int t = 0; t < windowsize_; t++) {
            Update gweight;	  // Compute the gradient for the weight matrix
            Compute gsrc[t];	// Compute the gradient for src layer
        }
    }



### RnnlmComputationLayer

This layer is a loss layer in which the performance metrics, both the probability of predicting the next word correctly, and perplexity (PPL in short) are computed. To be specific, this layer is composed of the class information part and the word information part. Therefore, the computation can be essentially divided into two parts by slicing this layer's weight matrix.

#### Configuration

In this layer, it is needed to specify whether to use a bias term during training.

    message RnnlmComputationProto {
        optional bool bias_term = 1 [default = true];  // use bias vector or not
    }


#### Functionality

In the forward phase, by using the two sliced weight matrices (one is for class information, another is for the words in this class), this RnnlmComputationLayer calculates the dot product between the source layer's input and the sliced matrices. The results can be denoted as "y1" and "y2". Then after a softmax function, for each input word, the probability distribution of classes and the words in this classes are computed. The activated results can be denoted as p1 and p2. Next, using the probability distribution, the PPL value is computed.

    void RnnlmComputationLayer::ComputeFeature() {
        Compute y1 and y2;
        p1 = Softmax(y1);
        p2 = Softmax(y2);
        Compute perplexity value called PPL;
    }

In the backward phase, this layer executes the following three computation operations. First, it computes the member gradient of the current layer by each timestamp. Second, this layer computes the gradient of its own weight matrix by aggregating calculated results from all timestamps. Third, it computes the gradient of its source layer, RnnlmSigmoidLayer, timestamp-wise.

    void RnnlmComputationLayer::ComputeGradient() {
    	  Compute grad[t] for all timestamps;
        Compute gweight by aggregating results computed in different timestamps;
        Compute gsrc[t] for all timestamps;
    }


## Configure Job

Job configuration is written in `job.conf`.
Users may need to specify model name, train/test steps, display frequency, and algorithm
as well as configurations of updater, layers, and cluster. For example,

    name: "rnnlm"
    train_steps: 71350
    test_steps: 10000
    test_freq: 2000
    disp_freq: 1000
    alg: kBP

    updater { }
    neuralnet {
        layer { }
        ...
    }
    cluster { }

Note that, for layer configuration, extended field names should be enclosed in brackets, e.g., [singa.rnnlmdata_conf], and `user_type` of string should be used to specify its layer type.

Start training by the following commands

    $ cd SINGA_ROOT
